Target Audience: Doctors, Clinicians, Nursing, Medstaff, Dental, Massage, Chiropractic, etc

Problem to address: medstaff spend 15-20 hours of overtime every week recording notes for insurance purposes. The medical industry is highly overburdened with patients and this steals from their time caring for patients. This will make their practice more efficient and better.

Primary goal of the product: make it easier for doctors to record patient interactions and report to insurance. The patients get more attention.
Provide a calendar that generates an html for each appointment, set up with patient name and date, then they press recording button to start capturing notes.
